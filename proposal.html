		<!-- Problem Description
		Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it. -->
		<p>
			Creating an appropriate virtual avatar for a user has long been a challenge for Virtual Reality. For the purposes of instantly recognizing others in a virtual setting, it is useful to have an avatar that looks similar to users in real life. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This project aims to make virtual masks that will mirror the faces of users in real life. We will begin with a point cloud of a face generated from a Kinect. We will convert this point cloud to a mesh using Poisson Surface Reconstruction. The mesh will then be synced with the location of a VR user's face and mirrored back to them so that they can see the results.

		<h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>
		<!-- Goals and Deliverables
		This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
		Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
		If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
		Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.
		What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
		You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan - planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan). -->

	<h3>Schedule</h3>
		<!-- Schedule
		In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week. -->
		<h4>1st Week (April 9th - April 15th)</h4>
		<p>
			We will start on the center of the project, working to acheive a functional point-cloud to mesh algorithm using the Poisson Surface Reconstruction. This phase of the project will involve additional research and comparison to existing solutions. 
		</p>
		<h4>2nd Week (April 16th - April 22)</h4>
		<p>
			In the second week, we will aim to finish our reconstruction algorithm and begin testing using pre-made point clouds.
		</p>
		<h4>3rd Week</h4>
		<p>
			We will start collecting Kinect data on faces using ICP and testing our algorithm on a real world model. During this time period, we will continue to polish our reconstruction algorithm as we begin to see messier results. Using real world data will provide its own challenges, but will have more rewarding results.
		</p>
		<h4>4th Week</h4>
		<p>
			We will start integrating our project into VR using OpenVR. We will use an OpenGL renderer to create a mirror and mask experience.

		<h3>Resources</h3>
		<!-- Resources
		List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here. -->
